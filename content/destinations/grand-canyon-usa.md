# Grand Canyon National Park - USA

The Grand Canyon is one of the world's most spectacular natural wonders, offering breathtaking views and incredible hiking opportunities.

## Why Visit the Grand Canyon?

The Grand Canyon is a geological masterpiece, carved by the Colorado River over millions of years. It's a must-see destination offering:
- Breathtaking panoramic views
- World-class hiking trails
- Incredible geology and history
- Dark sky stargazing
- Unique desert ecosystem

## South Rim vs North Rim

### South Rim
- Open year-round
- More accessible and developed
- More viewpoints and facilities
- Easier to reach

### North Rim
- Open May-October
- Higher elevation, cooler
- Fewer crowds
- More remote and wild

## Hiking

Popular trails include:
- **Bright Angel Trail**: Most popular, well-maintained
- **South Kaibab Trail**: Steeper, better views
- **Rim Trail**: Easy, flat, along the rim

**Important**: Hiking into the canyon is strenuous. Most people underestimate the difficulty of hiking back up.

## Planning Your Visit

- Book accommodations 6-12 months in advance
- Arrive early for parking (fills up by 9 AM)
- Bring layers - temperature varies greatly
- Stay hydrated - the desert is dry
