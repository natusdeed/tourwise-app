# Serengeti National Park, Tanzania

The Serengeti is one of Africa's most iconic safari destinations, famous for the annual Great Migration where over two million animals move across the plains in search of fresh grazing.

## Why Visit the Serengeti?

The Serengeti offers the most spectacular wildlife viewing in Africa. The Great Migration is considered one of the world's greatest natural spectacles, and the park is home to incredible biodiversity.

## The Great Migration

The migration is a year-round cycle where wildebeest, zebras, and gazelles move in search of water and fresh grass. The most dramatic moments are the river crossings, where thousands of animals brave crocodile-infested waters.

## Wildlife Viewing

The Serengeti is home to the Big Five and offers excellent predator viewing, especially lions and cheetahs. The park's diverse ecosystems support a wide variety of wildlife.

## Accommodations

From luxury lodges to mobile tented camps that follow the migration, the Serengeti offers various accommodation options. Mobile camps provide the best access to the migration.

## Planning Your Trip

The migration location varies by month, so timing is crucial. June to October offers the best dry season viewing, while December to March is calving season with excellent predator action.
